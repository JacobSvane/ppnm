Test of the newton method
First a simple linear equation f(x)=x+2 is tested, starting point set as 2 for the search
The algorithm provides the following root:
-2
Next the function f(x,y)=(4x+3y+2,xÂ²) is tested, starting points are set as 2,3 for the search
The algorithm provides the following root:
-0.570312505400117, 0.0937500072001559
Finally the Rosenbrock's valley function is tested, starting points are set as -3,-3 for the search. The expected value is 1,1 for the solution
The algorithm provides the following root:
0.999999052971619, 0.999998086579339
It is thus found that the algorithm works as intended
The algorithm is now used to calculated the solution to the energy of a Hydrogen atom in Hartree.
