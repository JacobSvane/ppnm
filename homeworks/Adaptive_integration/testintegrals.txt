Testing integrals within the expected accuracy which is given as 0.001 in this case
The integrals are tested using Math.Abs(clac-known) <= 0.001. If this is true, the integral is printed
∫₀¹ dx √(x) = 0.666680932893738, expected value = 2/3
∫₀¹ dx 1/√(x) = 1.99999738796403, expected value = 2
∫₀¹ dx 4*√(1-x²) = 3.14159750770263, expected value = 3.14159265358979
∫₀¹ dx ln(x)/√(x) = -3.99999834899021, expected value = -4
